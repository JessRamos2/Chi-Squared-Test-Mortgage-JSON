The Data is from [The Exchange by Fannie Mae](https://theexchange.fanniemae.com), a data resource provided from Fannie, one of the Government Sponsered Enterprises (GSE) of the mortgage industry. The data has mortgage-level data and provides information on the borrower such as race/ethnicity, gender, and loan purpose. 

This analysis explores the data, makes transformations, and performs chi-squared tests on variables to see if there are relationships between them. 

Included is a function, `chi_sq_test`, that takes 2 variables and a percentage. It outputs the necessary values and results of the Chi-Squared test.
